# Spotify Labelling
## Introduction
In my personal opinion, Spotify is a great platform for streaming music. However, it has one big downside: you cannot create "smart playlists" which create playlists based on one or multiple conditions. But that is no longer a limitation as that is exactly what Spotify Labelling offers us!



## Status
At this point, the project is still in the alpha phase (v0.14.0-alpha), where a few people are invited to test the application. The goal is to have a working application that can be released as beta in August or September. You can follow the progress by viewing the [changelog](https://github.com/BrentMeeusen/Spotify-Labelling/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).



## The application
The goal of the project was to make it as intuitive as possible to use, but if you happen to be unsure how you should use the application, you can read the explanation below. If you have an account, you can also [log in](http://spotify-labelling.21webb.nl/) and visit [this page](http://spotify-labelling.21webb.nl/how-it-works).

### Create an account
To get started, you create an account [here](http://spotify-labelling.21webb.nl/register). After verifying your account by clicking on the link in the email you will receive, you can log in. When logging in, you have to grant the application access through Spotify. If you don't do that, the application cannot make any changes and will not let you login.

### Import your songs
Once you have logged in, you will start off by selecting the songs you want to add to Spotify Labelling. This can be done by clicking the "Add Songs" button which will then allow you to choose the playlists to import the songs from, or you can choose to import the songs you saved. You will now be able to view all these songs on the page where you can search for them by label, song name, artist name, and rating, as well as update the rating.

### Sort your songs
Now you can start creating your own labels. There are already some global labels as well that many songs may belong to, like "Rock" and "EDM". With your songs imported and labels created, you can start making combinations. You can now give a song a label which will be used to create the playlists.

### Create smart playlists
At this point, you have imported your songs and given them a rating, created labels, and added those labels to your songs. Now there is only one more thing left to do: creating the playlists! When creating a playlist, you will give it a name the playlist will have (which will be the name in this application as well as in your own Spotify) and then add the requirements the songs must meet before making it in the playlist. The last step is to click the "Update Playlists" button, which will send all the changes to Spotify.

### Updating your songs
It is of course very possible that you gave a song a label, but you do not find it fitting anymore, or you like the song less so you want to lower its rating. All you have to do then is make your changes and click the "Update Playlists" button again. This will update the already existing playlists to match the new values!

## Credits
This project has been created by me, but I have been helped by a couple of my friends who I asked to be alpha tester. My special thanks go to [Teambeurnaut](https://github.com/Teambeurnaut) for being the most dedicated alpha tester. He helped me find many bugs and came up with some small features which, in total, made the application better usable.
