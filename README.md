# Spotify Labelling
## Introduction
In my personal opinion, Spotify is a great platform for streaming music. However, it has one big downside: you cannot create "smart playlists" which create playlists based on one or multiple conditions. But that is no longer a limitation as that is exactly what Spotify Labelling offers us!

## The application
<!-- This web application allows users to manage their account, manage their own labels, manage the songs they want to label, and manage the playlists that are created based on the desired label conditions. In addition, one is able to search for songs by track name, artist, and album. -->
<!-- Elaborate very precisely on what the application provides -->
To get started, you create an account [here](http://spotify-labelling.21webb.nl/register). After verifying your account by clicking on the link in the email you will receive, you can log in.

Once you have logged in, you will start off by selecting the songs you want to add to Spotify Labelling. This can be done by clicking the "Add Songs" button which will then allow you to choose the playlists to import the songs from. It also has an option to import your saved songs. You will now be able to view all these songs on the page where you can search for them by label, song name, artist name, and rating, as well as update the rating.
