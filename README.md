# Spotify Labelling
## Introduction
In my personal opinion, Spotify is a great platform for streaming music. However, it has one big downside: you cannot label songs and create playlists based on that. For example, one of my favourite songs is Hotel California by The Eagles. So I want it in my favourites playlist, but I also want it in a rock playlist. And then I want it to be in the rock playlist, but also in the classic rock playlist. This tool is going to help us with that!

This is the API for the application. <!-- The application itself can be found [here](https://google.com). -->
