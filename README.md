# Spotify Labelling
## Introduction
In my personal opinion, Spotify is a great platform for streaming music. However, it has one big downside: you cannot create "smart playlists" which create playlists based on one or multiple conditions. But that is no longer a limitation as that is exactly what Spotify Labelling offers us!

## The application
This web application allows users to manage their account, manage their own labels, manage the songs they want to label, and manage the playlists that are created based on the desired label conditions. In addition, one is able to search for songs by track name, artist, and album.
