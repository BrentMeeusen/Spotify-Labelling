# Spotify Labelling v0.6.0
## Introduction
In my personal opinion, Spotify is a great platform for streaming music. However, it has one big downside: you cannot label songs and create playlists based on that. For example, one of my favourite songs is Hotel California by The Eagles. So I want it in my favourites playlist, but I also want it in a rock playlist. And then I want it to be in the rock playlist, but also in the classic rock playlist. This tool is going to help us with that!

I really miss this feature. So when I found out that Spotify had an API that I can make use of, I figured I'd better get working on it.

## The application
This web application allows users to manage their account, manage their own labels, manage the songs they want to label, and manage the playlists that are created based on the desired label conditions. In addition, one is able to search for songs by track name, artist, and album.
