## 0.2.0 - 2021/05/04
This version mostly includes adding the UI.

### Added
- Register account UI.



## 0.1.0 - 2021/04/27
Note: I only started writing this changelog after I created the accounts system, which is why this version includes a lot of features. Every feature in here can only be used through software like Postman when it comes to any not GET request since I do not have created the UI yet.

### Added
- One can create an account.
- One can login to a created account.
- One can update and delete their own account.
- One can read all users (not a separate user, but all users in one request).
- JSON Web Tokens are generated on login.
